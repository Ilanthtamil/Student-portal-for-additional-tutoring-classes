# Student-portal-for-additional-tutoring-classes
A collaborative web application with the name "ACE tuition class" is being envisioned. When using the web application, teachers and students will be the users. Users can thus work cooperatively with one another. The main features of the app are attendance tracking, uploading, reviewing, and creating quizzes, exercises, and discussion forums.
